## Licences

`LICENSES.md` list all licenses : some files use a different license than the centralized one, they are listed in the _Exception_ part of the document.

`trello-backup.pyw` is based on [Trello Backup](https://github.com/smartystreets/trello-backup) by [Smarty](https://github.com/smartystreets) and as such uses the MIT License (lso written inside the file).
